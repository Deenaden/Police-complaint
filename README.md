# 🚨 AI & Blockchain-Powered Police Complaint Management System

Welcome to the next generation of law enforcement technology — a trailblazing system that harnesses the power of AI, blockchain, and decentralized storage to transform the way emergencies are reported and FIRs are filed.
---

## 🌟 Overview

This platform enables **citizens** to raise emergency complaints via **voice or text**, which are then analyzed by an AI engine to assign **priority levels**. Authorities are automatically dispatched, real-time tracking is initiated, and every action is recorded on the **EDUCHAIN blockchain** to prevent tampering.

Our solution restores **public trust** in emergency services and law enforcement by making the complaint process **secure, trackable, and transparent**.

## 🔍 Key Problems Solved

- **FIR Tampering & Delays**  
  Immutable blockchain records make manipulation impossible and automate escalation.

- **Lack of Transparency**  
  Real-time tracking of officer response and case status visible to users.

- **Inefficient Complaint Handling**  
  AI prioritizes urgent cases and routes them automatically to the right personnel.

- **Privacy Risks**  
  Decentralized storage ensures data privacy with verifiable access controls.

## 💡 Core Features

### 🧠 1. AI-Based Voice & Text Complaint Analysis
- Citizens can file complaints via call or text.
- Ollama running **DeepSeek R1 8B** parses the content and urgency.
- Assigns a **priority score** (e.g. red = critical, yellow = moderate).

### 🚔 2. Officer Auto-Assignment & SLA Tracking
- Nearest available officer is automatically notified.
- Officers must update:
  - 📍 Live location
  - 🚨 Status (en route, investigating, resolved)
- Tracks SLA (response time, handling time) compliance.

### 🔗 3. Blockchain-Powered FIR Recording
- Each case, once verified, becomes a **smart contract-backed FIR**.
- Stored immutably on **EDUCHAIN** using Solidity smart contracts.
- All updates are version-controlled and cryptographically signed.

### 🗄️ 4. IPFS-Based Complaint & Evidence Storage
- Complaint forms, voice logs, and attachments are uploaded to **IPFS**.
- Access is controlled through encryption and smart contracts.
- Protects from leaks, deletion, or unauthorized viewing.

### 🔁 5. Escalation Engine for Inaction
- AI auto-monitors every complaint.
- If no action is taken in X minutes:
  - Escalates to higher authority (e.g. DSP, SP)
  - Sends reminders via Telegram/Web interface

### 🤖 6. Telegram Bot Interface (for Citizens)
- Citizens can use a **Telegram WebApp bot** to:
  - Submit complaints with voice/text/image
  - Track complaint status
  - View FIR logs and assigned officer details
